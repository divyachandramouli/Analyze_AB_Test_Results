# Analyze A/B Test Results

The goal of this project is to support decision making for an e-commerce company by analyzing the results of A/B test (using Python). The company needs to decide whether they should implement the new version of their web page or keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. 

## Outline of analysis
After assessing the data, decisions were made about dealing with duplicates, and mismatched values. Probability computations, hypothesis testing  and logistic regression were performed on the data using Pandas, Numpy, and the statsmodels module in Python.  Backed by statistical inferences from the analysis, recommendations for deciding the web page version were made and limitations of the analysis were documented.
